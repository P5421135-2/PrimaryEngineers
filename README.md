The task for the project is to create a backpack that will allow hearing impaired cyclists to have visual indicators of where cars are and how close they are to the cyclist and warn drivers when they are too close.


The github repository will house all the code that makes up the functionality of the backpack, all physical assembly and construction will be handled in person at the scheduled meetings.
